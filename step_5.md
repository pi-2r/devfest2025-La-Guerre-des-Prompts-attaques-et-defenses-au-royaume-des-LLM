## Access to the playground

The next steps of the lab rely on a playground developed by Microsoft during the [Black Hat USA 2024](https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/training/schedule/index.html#ai-red-teaming-in-practice-37464) event.  
The official repository is available here: [https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs).

To use the playground, you have two options:

- If you have followed the prerequisites and installed the playground, go to:  
  `http://localhost:5000/login?auth=YOUR_AUTH_KEY` (the value of **YOUR_AUTH_KEY** is found in the **.env** file)  
  to log in locally.

- If you have not installed the playground on your machine, you can access it directly via this codelab URL: **TODO ==> INSERT_IP**.

Here is what the playground interface looks like:
