Microsoft PyRIT Jailbreak Detection Demo
========================================
This demo showcases the advanced jailbreak detection patterns we've integrated
from Microsoft's PyRIT (Python Risk Identification Toolkit) repository.

PyRIT is Microsoft's official red-teaming tool for LLM security testing.
We've analyzed their "Pliny" jailbreak techniques and integrated them into our detection system.
